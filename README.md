## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. The two variables that had the most amount of random variance are ground_clearance     and vehicle_length.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  Our slope is not zero just be looking at the p-value.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  Our R-squared value is .6825 showing a strong positive correlation in the values.
